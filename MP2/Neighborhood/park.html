<h1> Park </h1>
<hr>

<body>
<div>You're standing in a park. There are children running around on a distant hilly patch of grass. Some parents are relaxing on the benches several feet beside you. Familiar sounds of laughter, dogs barking, and low chatter fill the air. <br>What isn't familiar is the park itself. Or any of the shops across the street. Or how you even arrived at this location. </div>
<br>
You feel unsettled. But at least this seems to be a safe area.
