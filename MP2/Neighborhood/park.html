<div>You're standing in a park. There are children running around on a distant hilly patch of grass. Some parents are relaxing on the benches several feet beside you. Familiar sounds of laughter, dogs barking, and low chatter fill the air. <br>What isn't familiar is the park itself. Or any of the shops across the street. Or how you even arrived at this location. </div>
<br>
You feel unsettled. But at least this seems to be a safe area.

<div>Try to find your way home</div>
<div>Ask one of the parents what park this is</div>
<div>Use your cell phone for help</div>
