<div>You walk down the street for a couple blocks and take in the surroundings. The shops and park disappear and soon it it's all just houses. They begin to look familiar...</div>
<br>
Thank goodness, you found your house. The front porch never looked so inviting as did now. You breath a sigh of relief. <br>
<br>
<div>You realize most of the houses on your own street don't look familiar at all. The old homes that were there for the longest time seemed to all have been replaced quite recently. It's hardly recognizable to when you bought your home decades ago.</div>
