<div><b> Hi how are you doing?</b></div>
<br>
The neighbor turns around and smiles. They give a friendly wave and walk over to you.
<br>
<br>
"I'm doing well, we just started making dinner. We were actually about to go over and ask if you would like some too!"
<br>
<br>
<div><b> Oh honey you don't have to, that's too kind. But I'm not gonna say no to that baked mac n cheese casserole you two make. </b></div>
<br>
"Alrighty, we'll have that ready for you by tonight then!" <br>
They appear sympathetic for a moment. <br>
"How have you been holding up the past couple weeks? I can't imagine it's been easy... My partner and I never planned on having children but we've both had our fair share of losses in the family. <br> I know your daughter helps out plenty but we're always here for you too."
