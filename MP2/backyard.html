<h1> Backyard </h1>

<div>The backyard looks lovely in the late afternoon sun. You observe your small garden that lines the interior of the fence. It's filled with flowers and shrubbery. Watching the pastel blue <i>Forget-Me-Nots</i> bob in the breeze fills you with a sense of comfort. </div>
<br>
You hear some scuffling to your left. Looking around, you catch a glimpse of the neighbor taking out their trash. You've known them for quite some time but it feels like it has been a while since you have had a conversation with them. Perhaps this is good oppurtunity to catch up.
