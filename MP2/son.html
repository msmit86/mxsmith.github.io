"Your son? We offered to take you to his funeral reception last week but you seemed too distraught to go.""
<br>
<div><b>"I didn't hear of any funeral reception for my son! No one even told me he passed away! Is my daughter keeping this from me too?!"</b></div>
<br>
<div>Your neighbor looks concerned rather than shocked. </div>
<br>
"You remember he had a heart attack right? He didn't make it to the hospital in time for a full recovery so they put him on life support... Unfortuntly he wasn't able to get out of the coma and his family decided to let him go. I believe you were with them when they did it."
<br>
"And the reception, it was good. A lot of people came for him and shared their memories. We missed having you there but- it's understandable how it can be painful too."
<br>
<br>
<div><b>What? I wouldn't miss my son's funeral. I didn't even know he was on life support! Didn't he leave the hospital?</b></div>
<br>
"Uhh- We all came to inform you of the decision. And we've been checking on you over the past few weeks. I know your daughter and your son's family had told you about the service. And like I said we were going to drive you there... <br>
Did you want to come inside with us for a bit?"
<br>
<br>
You're a little too confused and frustrated at the moment. 
<div><b> No thank you. I think I need a moment to think this through</b><br> You turn away into your own yard. </div>
<br>
You're not sure how many people have been keeping your son's death from you. Is it really true that they all told you? And the fact that there was a reception you hadn't heard of until just now? That can't be right... <br> The confusion gives in to overwhelming sorrow. You realize one of your children is gone forever, and you can't remember saying goodbye to them.
