<h1> Porch </h1>
<hr>

You are sitting on the porch taking in the scenery. It is a lovely day outside. <br> You watch the trees sway in the breeze while birds flutter atop the branches. Except for the occasional car passing by, there is no one around. <br> You are not sure how long you have been sitting outside. Perhaps you dozed off earlier and lost track of time.
