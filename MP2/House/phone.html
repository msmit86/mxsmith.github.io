<div><b>Hello?</b></div>
<br>
<div><i>Hi mom how's it going? </i></div>
<br>
Oh it's your daughter, what a pleasant surprise. You feel like you haven't hear from her in a while.
<div><b>Oh it's been alright sweetie. I've been taking it easy as usual. I saw a yellow crested warbler while I was out on the porch earlier. They are such a rare sight these days!</b></div>
<br>
<div><i> Haha that's neat! I was just calling to see if you needed anything else from the store. I remember you called me yesterday saying you were running low on cottage cheese and bananas.</i></div>
<br>
<div><b>Did I call you yesterday? Sweetie I must be losing my mind I don't remember doing that. But thank you, I probably do need those things.<br>Speaking of bananas, I saw a recipe for Etta's banana bread a while ago. Do you recall who that is?</b></div>
<br>
<div><i>Grandma Etta? Yes of course, that's Dad's mom. We were making her banana bread recipe last week at your home...that's why you're low on bananas. </i></div>
<br>
<div><b> Ohh I see..</b>Gosh that's right, how could you forget? That banana bread was indeed delicious</div>
<br>
<div><i> Well if you need anything else, let me know! I'll be heading out soon so I'll see you in a bit. Let me know if you decide to head out in the meantime.</i></div>
<br>
<div><b>You're a doll, thank you honey. Don't worry about me, I'll be right here at home. Your father on the other hand decided to go out for a stroll. I can't seem to find him around here but you know how spontaneous he can be sometimes.</b> (you chuckle)</div>
<br>
There's a pause on the line
<br>
<br>
<div><i>Mom...</i></div><br>
<i>Dad is at the Autumn Creek home. He can't walk anymore. Do you remember? He's been there over a year now. If you want we can go visit him.</i><br>
