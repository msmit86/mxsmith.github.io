<h1> House - Living Room </h1>
<hr>
<body>
<section>
<p>The door opens with some squeaky resistence. Inside the living room you see a cozy assortment consisting of a squishy looking sofa, two reclining living chairs, a coffee table, and a widescreen TV on top of a stand. Further down the room is a fireplace with a mantle of photos hanging above it. It is all quite familiar. Although it odd that your husband isn't asleep on one of the reclining chairs. Usually at this time in the afternoon you can find him dozing off to a baseball game on the television.
<div><p>There is an end table at one corner of the room with an old record player on it. You remember it was the first anniversary gift your husband ever gave to you. It's a wonder how it still works after all these years.</p></div>
