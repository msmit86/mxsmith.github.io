Light shines through the kitchen windows showering the countertops with golden light. Everything looks to be in place except for a stool by the island. It's slightly askew indicating someone has been eating there. You walk up to the fridge and see a few pictures hanging by magnets. On the surface beside the fridge is a battered cookbook with paper and bookmarks sticking out on all ends.
