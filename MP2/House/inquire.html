<div><i> Mom we've gone over this several times now. Don't you remember how he injured his back when going down the stairs? <br> You were the one who called us to drive him to the hospital. He's doing alright but it worries us that you always forget where he is. <br>

	Please don't go looking for him again in the neighborhood.

<div> <b>Are you saying he's been gone all this time? I'm sorry but I'm gonna need a moment...</b></div><br>
<div><i> There's another thing too but I'll wait until I'm there to discuss with you. Take care now mom. Love you.</i></div>
