The bedroom looks as how it usually does. Light filters in through the curtains onto the bed. There are end tables situated on either side of the bed. A phone sits on one of them and a lamp on the other.  You observe the bed is made. <br> It is empty. 
<br>

You stand there for a few moments wondering where your husband could have gone off too. His reading books are nowhere to be seen and neither are his reading glasses. You hadn't seen them downstairs either. Now that you think of it, you hadn't seen his jacket or shoes anywhere either. Perhaps he did go out after all...<br>
<br>
The bedside phone rings.
